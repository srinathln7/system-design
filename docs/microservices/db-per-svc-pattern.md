# Database per Service Pattern in Microservices

1. **Introduction to Microservices:**
   - Microservices should be loosely coupled and autonomous to make independent decisions.
   - The Database per Service pattern is a high-level architecture pattern that enables the autonomy of microservices.

2. **Microservices and Data Storage:**
   - Microservices require data storage for maintaining state information (e.g., orders, payments).
   - The database per service pattern involves each microservice having its own independent database.

3. **Benefits of Database per Service:**
   - **Loose Coupling:** Promotes loose coupling between microservices, making them independent in development, testing, deployment, and scaling.
   - **Specific Needs:** Allows choosing specialized databases to fulfill specific needs (e.g., graph databases, NoSQL, or traditional relational databases).
   - **Granular Scaling Control:** Provides granular control over scaling, allowing each service to choose an optimal scaling strategy based on its use case.
   - **Isolation during Outages:** Reduces the impact of database outages to only the services directly dependent on the affected database.

4. **Separate Compliance Needs:**
   - Enables separate compliance measures for specific types of data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), by applying encryption selectively.

5. **Challenges of Database per Service:**
   - **Complex Cross-Service Transactions:** Implementing transactions across multiple services is complex and expensive, potentially slowing down throughput.
   - **Update Conveyance Between Services:** Conveying updates across services requires an asynchronous system or message broker, introducing eventual consistency.
   - **Management Complexity:** Multiple types of databases require expertise in monitoring, managing, and scaling, posing challenges for engineering teams.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Database per Service architecture offers advantages in autonomy, loose coupling, and scalability.
   - However, challenges include complex transactions, update conveyance, and the need for diverse expertise in managing various databases.
