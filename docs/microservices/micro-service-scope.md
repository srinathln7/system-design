## Microservices Scoping 

## Overview:
- Microservices present a tempting solution for various problems, offering the opportunity to address specific issues.
- Deciding when to create a microservice involves considering the granularity of the problem and whether to create separate microservices or combine them to solve larger problems.

## Core Concepts:
1. **Low Coupling and High Cohesion:**
   - *Low Coupling:* Changes in one service should not necessitate changes in another. Emphasizes flexibility in modifying individual services without affecting others.
   - *High Cohesion:* Components with related behavior should be grouped together within a service, promoting independence and efficiency.

2. **Guiding Principles:**
   - *Loose Coupling:* 
     - Services should expose minimal information to each other.
     - Critical considerations include public APIs, authentication APIs, rate limits, and communication protocols.
     - Isolation of services to prevent unnecessary dependencies.

   - *High Cohesion:*
     - Related components within a service should be closely knit.
     - Avoid placing unrelated components together, as it can lead to unnecessary dependencies and slower development.

## Practical Considerations:
1. **Transitioning from Monolith to Microservices:**
   - When transitioning, be cautious about sharing codebases between a monolith and a microservice.
   - Strictly define boundaries to prevent complications during deployment and unnecessary dependencies.

2. **Fencing Microservices:**
   - Determine the level of coupling between components before deciding on microservice boundaries.
   - Minimize cross-service communication to avoid performance issues and enhance simplicity.
   - Keep related functionalities within a service for improved cohesion.

## Key Takeaways:
- Balance is crucial; having too few or too many microservices can lead to challenges in development and deployment.
- **Loose coupling** ensures flexibility and transparency in communication between services.
- **High cohesion** promotes efficient development by keeping related components together.

## Conclusion:
- Microservices provide exciting opportunities but require careful consideration of scoping.
- Adopting principles of loose coupling and high cohesion helps create robust, flexible, and extensible architectures.
