# Shared Database Pattern in Microservices**

## Key concepts:
- Microservices often need to communicate with each other to get or update data owned by other services.
- The shared database pattern allows microservices to communicate by letting them directly talk to a common database, avoiding a middleman API server.
- Challenges and considerations associated with the shared database pattern are discussed in the video.
- Advantages of the shared database pattern:
  1. **Simplicity:** Direct communication with the database simplifies integration, eliminating the need for complex communication processes.
  2. **Low Latency:** No extra network hops lead to faster communication.
  3. **Quick Development Times:** Services can independently update the database, reducing cross-team efforts and enabling faster development.
  4. **Simpler Operations:** Both services talking to the same database result in straightforward operations.
  5. **Better Performance:** No middleman and no extra network hops lead to improved overall performance.

## Challenges of the Shared Database Pattern:
1. **External Parties Getting Internal Details:**
   - Analytics team, an external party, needs to understand the internal details and schema of the Blocks database, leading to potential complications.

2. **Changes in Schema Impacting Dependent Services:**
   - If the Blocks service changes its schema, dependent services like Analytics need to adjust their logic, causing tight coupling and reducing autonomy.

3. **Risk of Data Corruption and Deletion:**
   - Multiple services having read and write access to the same database increases the risk of accidental data corruption or deletion.

4. **Shared Database Abuse:**
   - One service's resource-intensive queries can impact the performance of other services sharing the same database, leading to abuse potential.

## Mitigations and Considerations:
1. **Access Controls:**
   - Implement strict database-level access controls to limit each service's access to specific tables and prevent data corruption.

2. **Schema Stability:**
   - Consider using the shared database pattern when the schema is stable and not subject to frequent changes.

3. **Read Load Offloading to Replicas:**
   - Move read loads to read replicas to prevent resource-intensive queries from affecting critical operations on the main database.

## Use Cases for Shared Database Pattern:
1. **Quick Solutions for Lean Teams:**
   - Ideal for small teams and startups where speed and agility are prioritized over complex microservices communication.

2. **Stable Schemas:**
   - Suitable when the database schema is stable and not expected to change frequently.

3. **Read Load Management:**
   - Effective when read loads can be offloaded to replicas to prevent performance impact on critical services.

## Conclusion:
- The shared database pattern is not inherently wrong but requires careful consideration of its challenges and benefits.
- Use it judiciously based on specific use cases, such as speed requirements, schema stability, and effective load management.

## Additional Information:
- A system may evolve from sharing databases in the early stages to adopting more complex communication patterns as it matures.
- No communication pattern is universally right or wrong; consider the specific needs of your system.
